# Sortify

## Overview
Sortify is a simple C# program that automatically sorts files located on your Desktop into their appropriate directories.  
For example, documents, images, compressed files, and other file types are moved into organized folders such as **Documents**, **Pictures**, or **Compressed**.  

The goal of this project is to keep your desktop clean and organized without requiring manual sorting.

## Features
- Detects files in the Desktop directory.  
- Moves them into categorized folders based on their extension.  
- Automatically creates target folders (if they donâ€™t already exist).  
- Console output shows where each file was moved.

1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open the project in Visual Studio (or your preferred IDE).  
3. Build and run the program.  
4. Any files on your Desktop will be sorted automatically.

## Future Plans
- **Expand Sorting Beyond Desktop**  
  Currently, the program only sorts files in the Desktop directory.  
  In future updates, it will include other locations such as **Downloads**, **Documents**, and custom user-defined folders.  

- **Configuration Options**  
  Allow users to customize which file types go into which folders.  

- **Scheduled Runs**  
  Add an option to automatically run the sorter on a timer or at system startup.
